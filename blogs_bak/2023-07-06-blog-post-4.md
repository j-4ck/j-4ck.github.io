UnixCRK
------

This will be a short piece of writing today, since the workings of this script are very simple - being at only around 70 lines of code, really the engine of this script can be condensed down to around 10-20 lines.
The script can be found [here](https://github.com/j-4ck/unixcrk), and if you are at all familiar with the GNU/Unix operating system style and have an entry level understanding of dictionary attacks, you will very quickly see what's going on.


How does it work?
------
The first step is retrieving the hashed password from /etc/shadow - if the current user does not have the privileges to view the file, it asks for a manual entry.

As you can see it uses the commands module to execute the cat command and view the content of /etc/shadow - then using grep to filter through the output (2 commands native to Unix systems). If successful, it is then seperated into 8 sections and the first one is returned.
Since we can recreate the system hashing process with the [Crypt](https://docs.python.org/3/library/crypt.html) library, we can iterate through a dictionary and hash each item - if the hashed version matches the hash in /etc/shadow, we now know the unhashed version. Since this method of cryptographic storage is based off of one way encryption, we cannot simply "decrypt" the hash.
Hence why we rely on the dictionary attack method.

Here, although very overcomplicated, the cracking function can simply be reduced to a simple if-else loop:
1. Encrypt potential word using the same method as operating system
1. If hash from encrypted word matches, the password must be our word
1. If not, try different word and continue

Summary
------
This is a short piece of writing today because as you can see, there really is not more to this project. The only improvements you could make would be using multi-threaded encryption attempts for timesaves or trying to implement a brute force method (though doing the latter in 2023 really is deprecated).
Just wanted to share this short piece of theory since it is still incredibly basic and useful today.
