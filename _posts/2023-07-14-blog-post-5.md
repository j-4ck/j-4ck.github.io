WinTrojan
------

This blog post aims to serve as a short overview of an old personal project of mine written in [Golang](https://go.dev/), WinTrojan.
As the name suggests, the program carries a piece of potentially dangerous software into a target's environment and carries out some malicious operations.


What is a Trojan?
------

A trojan is a piece of code or software that appears legitimate but often carries a malicious payload (of many sorts). There are many ways of doing this, with the main motivators being evading anti-virus and bypassing firewall protection. 
Trojans can also make standard viruses and malicious software even more dangerous, since many implement tricky techniques in order to maximize their success rate.

Some of these techniques include:
+ Persistence

> When software embeds itself within the target system (usually somewhere in the start up process) so that it can execute even after the machine turns off. Writing the malware to the disk and essentially moving the code from volatile to non-volatile memory ensures that it survives a full restart.

+ Encoding/Encryption

> Very often, antivirus or a firewall will detect common malware executables in a network or system since their signatures have already been logged to their malware database. One solution for this is encoding the raw executable, storing the data within the trojan and having it drop it in the system/network

The stages of WinTrojan
------

If we look at the first portion of the main function, we can see that it consists of determining a random seed, creating a random file name (with a max length of 30, using the getRandomName function) and then storing the encoded executable file as a huge string (hence why you will see in the functions, we always reference it's pointer).
The getRandomName function is relatively simple, it just generates a random string of chars with a given upper boundary.

Next, the trojan uses the systems environment variables to determine the location of %appdata%/Roaming. If you are not familiar with this location of the windows filesystem I reccomend you familiarise yourself with this - but essentially it's trying to find a tricky undetermined location to hide the malware - so it navigates to %appdata%/Local,
where it finds another random pre-existing folder to embed itself within. After it does this it re-uses getRandomName to give itself a new random name.
It makes sure as to not overwrite over pre-existing files or mess with the environment too much, as it doesn't want to flag up antivirus software.

Now the next stage really needs dissecting, since it mainly makes references to other functions. First it waits a random amount of time between 1 and 10 seconds before it writes the decoded malware to the location, adding it to the start up and executing it.
