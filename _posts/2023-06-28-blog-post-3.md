CredSniffer
------

CredSniffer is a small packet handler I designed in Python to sniff network traffic for raw FTP credentials.
The script requires the attacker to already have a MITM or physical bridge between the target and the router/modem, in order to start capturing such data. I have written many pieces of code to achieve this although any generic ARP spoof will work just as fine.

Security
------

The method of gathering FTP credentials via packet sniffing is nothing new, and operates on a very basic security flaw.
During the process of authenticating an FTP user, the username and password are sent across the network in plain text. Because of this, if you know when/ where to listen, all the attacker has to do is start sniffing for packets and wait.

What makes CredSniffer different?
------

CredSniffer includes a short little function which can validate the credentials. Although you might be listening for credentials, you don't necessarily know if they are valid without trying them. CredSniffer will listen for username and password combinations, and verify they are correct. This can make the scope of an attack much smaller and save plenty of time.


How does it work?
------

For the first stage of the attack, the script uses [Scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) in order to listen to and analyse the packet traffic.
We do this by creating a packet handler, and telling it to log the destination IP and port of the packet (so that we know the location of the FTP server), and then check the raw payload of the packet for the identifiers "USER" and "PASS".

After the attacker is done sniffing, the program uses the help of the FTP libary for python to validate the credentials. As you can see this section is very simple.
