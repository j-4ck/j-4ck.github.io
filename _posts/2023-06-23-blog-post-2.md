Deadly cereal
------

Todays blog post is about another old project of mine, [KeyLogs](https://github.com/j-4ck/KeyLogs). The idea for this project was to build off of the age-old password hijacking method of keylogging - but to implement it in a more modern, robust sense. In order to achieve this, I decided I wanted to give the attacker wireless capabilities and also let them capture a little more data.
So the idea is very simple.. the client opens and runs the malware, which if connected to the internet, will call back to the attacker and start reading off the keyboard presses in real time, as they are being pressed.

Security/ firewall evasion
------

Now obviously, if a systems administrator sees constant traffic streaming keyboard presses across the internet to another device, they will instantly shut down the connection and our attack vector is lost. So we need to somehow hide or scramble the data being sent to the attacker...
A relatively easy way to solve this situation is to encrypt the data. I decided to use AES256 encryption, due to its strength and simplicity to implement in Python (with the use of Crypto.Cipher/PyCrypto and so on). Scrambling this information as it is sent across the network gives us a little bit more time before we are discovered, though it leads us to a minor issue. The key for the encryption cipher must be hardcoded into the malware. And since this program is written in python, any systems admin who notices the suspicious traffic will trace it back to the program - check the source, find the key and then reveal the sensitive information. This leads onto my next topic of discussion.

Malware etiquette
------

Since we have sensitive information (decryption keys, source IP address, ports etc.) in our malware source, I would highly advise that you trigger this script very carefully. Simply sending the malware and waiting for a click won't cut it in this case. You should be looking for better concealed vectors, like obfuscating the code and then embedding it in a seemingly legitimate piece of software.
Discovery of the keys will ruin your cover and the operation will fall apart, so the more unique and creative you are with your attack vector, the better.

Lots and lots of libraries...
------

Now, we have a nice attack setup but we still have 1 problem. Since we are leveraging the use of modules like PyCrypto and Pynput, the target must have them installed for the script to run. These are obviously not a part of the standard library that comes pre-installed when you install python, and the chances of the target already having them installed is very low - and a stupid risk to take if you actually want to land hits with this script. 
So it's safe to presume the target will run our script but not actually have any of the modules installed... Due to this, when the malware runs, I have added a function that checks if all of the necessary modules are installed - and if not, it will begin to install them in the background before the malware fully executes. I did this with the help of the PIP module, see below.

Added functionality
------

While writing this I was fascinated by the range of data you can capture with Pynput. I quickly found out that you can also easily capture the location of the mouse on the screen at any time along with mouse clicks and so on. So I had to implement that into the code, meaning that now the attacker can receive an encrypted stream of keyboard presses AND mouse movements / presses.. Giving them full access to whatever the target is typing / clicking live.

Conclusion
------

The idea behind this attack is quite robust - with it's main downsides coming from the nature of the language it was written in. Although it is not unrealistic to envision a scenario where an attacker has a stealth shell within a target network but doesn't want to have obvious traffic running from the shell all day, so steathily deploys KeyLogs to remotely capture potentially sensitive information. If needs be, you could easily port this idea across to something a little more universal, like GoLang, since it is cross-compilable (solving the issue of using sneaky attack vectors and having raw data left in the malware source).
