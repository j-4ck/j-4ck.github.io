So..... my long awaited first post
------

I have decided that I will dedicate these posts to small code findings and documenting old scripts - so what better way to start than with a script I wrote before I was even able to watch John Wick in cinemas, yet is still effective today! The reason I have decided to talk about this script in particular is because although it's very simple in it's nature, it can still lead to effective recon today. Along with this, its simplicity is part of the reason this software is working half a decade down the line with no maintenance!

What does it do?
------

The project in question today is [accountFinder](https://github.com/j-4ck/accountFinder).
If you flick over the files, you will see the process is very straightforward. Leveraging the fact that:
+ Many people use the same online alias across different websites, making them east to discover  
+ Many websites have account URLs that include the account name instead of an account ID or other unique identifiers.  

This means, if we could create a general list of urls tailored to our targets account name, all we really have to do is send a request to each page and check for a 200 OK response. This ancient tool is just a nice way of collecting these URLs together for you, and notifying which ones hit and which don't. Another nice feature I included (and still feel is relevant to my coding style today) is the ease of customization. If you want the software to be checking more websites, all you have to do is follow the syntax in `socials.txt` and append the link.
Below is a sample output, as you can see the script just creates multiple threads to go out and check the URLs. If you encounter false positives, the website may not be supported or the formatting in `socials.txt` could be incorrect.
