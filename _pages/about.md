Since I was 12 years old I have been in love with programming. What started off as a simple interest in database management and software bugs quickly turned into a broader software programming interest. After exploring different programming languages, my attention diverted towards networking and cyber security, part taking in competitions held online aka [CTFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)). Slowly I became more interested with writing secure clean solutions for a wider range of projects, eventually working in freelance as a software engineer (specifically for Python and Golang).
