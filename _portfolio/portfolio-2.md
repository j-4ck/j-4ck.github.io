This project aimed to fine tune and automate marketing + engagement with social media fans in the form of a chrome extension.


Problem
-------

A successful social media manager contacted me requiring real time local analytics on his clients and sales through a popular social media platform online. The only specification was that the software should run in the form of a chrome extension (which sadly meant more JavaScript). The data was to be mapped in multiple relational excel spreadsheets.

Solution
-------

For this project I had to put my anti-JavaScript prejudices to one side and knuckle down. It included lawful uses of web-scraping and data analysis, as well as usability and formatting. The project involved processing data such as email addresses, user IDs, purchases and contact information from the social media service. I would have preferred to have written the software in a language such as Python in order to allow me more freedom with handling/processing user data, though the natural constraints of the project forced me to push myself and take new approaches.

Notes
-------

This project forced me to undertake tasks I am very comfortable with, in an environment I am less comfortable with. I have created many HTTP/S scraping projects before, but by this point I was very new to JavaScript and especially packaging projects in the form of a chrome extension. Overall the project was successful, paid well and taught me to transfer acquired skills across different languages/ environments.
